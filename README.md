GIT PULL 


Adding Changes from VS Code to GitHub
Understanding the Process
To push your code changes from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to GitHub, you'll typically follow these steps:

Stage Changes: Prepare files for commit.
Commit Changes: Create a snapshot of your changes.
Push Changes: Upload the commit to GitHub.
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Stage Changes
Open your project in VS Code.   
In the Source Control panel (usually on the left), you'll see a list of changed files.   
Click on the plus icon next to the files you want to stage.
2. Commit Changes
In the Source Control panel, write a clear and concise commit message describing your changes.
Click on the "Commit" button.
3. Push Changes
Click on the three dots in the Source Control panel.
Select "Push".
If this is the first time pushing to the remote repository, you might need to set up the remote URL.
Using Git Commands (Optional)
If you prefer using the command line, you can open the integrated terminal in VS Code and use the following commands:

Bash
git add .  # Stages all changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main  # Replace 'main' with your branch name
Use code with caution.

Additional Tips
Create descriptive commit messages: This helps you and others understand the changes made.
Use branches: Create branches for different features to keep your code organized.
Resolve conflicts: If someone else has made changes to the same files, you might need to resolve conflicts before pushing.
Pull changes: Regularly pull changes from the remote repository to avoid conflicts.
